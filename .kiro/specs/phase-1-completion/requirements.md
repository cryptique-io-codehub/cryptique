# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification covers the completion of Phase 1 infrastructure setup for CQ Intelligence, specifically implementing Phase 1C (Data Migration Service) and Phase 1D (Advanced Query Processing Engine). These components will complete the foundational infrastructure needed for the enhanced analytics platform with vector search capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Data Migration Service Implementation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a comprehensive data migration service that can migrate all existing CQ Intelligence data to the new vector-based system, so that we can transition seamlessly without data loss.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration service is initialized THEN it SHALL connect to both source and destination databases
2. WHEN migration is started THEN the system SHALL process data in configurable batches to manage memory usage
3. WHEN migrating analytics data THEN the system SHALL preserve all relationships and metadata
4. WHEN migrating campaign data THEN the system SHALL maintain attribution relationships
5. WHEN migrating transaction data THEN the system SHALL preserve blockchain transaction details
6. WHEN migrating user journey data THEN the system SHALL maintain session relationships
7. WHEN data validation fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and continue with valid records
8. WHEN migration encounters errors THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
9. WHEN migration is paused THEN the system SHALL save checkpoint data for resumption
10. WHEN migration completes THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive validation reports

### Requirement 2: Migration Progress Tracking and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want real-time progress tracking and monitoring during data migration, so that I can monitor the process and intervene if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migration starts THEN the system SHALL track total records to be migrated
2. WHEN processing records THEN the system SHALL update progress in real-time
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
4. WHEN migration is running THEN the system SHALL provide estimated completion time
5. WHEN migration completes THEN the system SHALL generate success/failure statistics
6. WHEN queried THEN the system SHALL provide current migration status via API

### Requirement 3: Data Validation and Integrity Checks

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want comprehensive data validation during migration, so that I can ensure data integrity and quality in the new system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating data THEN the system SHALL validate data structure and types
2. WHEN generating embeddings THEN the system SHALL validate embedding quality scores
3. WHEN migration completes THEN the system SHALL verify record counts match source data
4. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error reports
5. WHEN data integrity issues are found THEN the system SHALL flag them for manual review

### Requirement 4: Advanced Query Processing Engine

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an advanced query processing engine that can understand natural language queries and convert them to optimized vector searches, so that users can get accurate analytics insights.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving a natural language query THEN the system SHALL classify the query intent
2. WHEN processing queries THEN the system SHALL extract relevant entities (timeframes, metrics, filters)
3. WHEN query intent is determined THEN the system SHALL select appropriate search strategy
4. WHEN executing vector search THEN the system SHALL combine vector similarity with metadata filtering
5. WHEN search results are found THEN the system SHALL rank results by relevance and confidence
6. WHEN no results are found THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative queries
7. WHEN query is ambiguous THEN the system SHALL request clarification from user
8. WHEN processing complex queries THEN the system SHALL break them into sub-queries

### Requirement 5: Query Optimization and Caching

**User Story:** As a system user, I want fast query responses, so that I can get analytics insights without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN common queries are executed THEN the system SHALL cache results with appropriate TTL
2. WHEN similar queries are made THEN the system SHALL reuse cached embeddings
3. WHEN query patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL precompute common results
4. WHEN cache is full THEN the system SHALL implement LRU eviction strategy
5. WHEN query performance is slow THEN the system SHALL optimize search parameters
6. WHEN concurrent queries are made THEN the system SHALL handle them efficiently

### Requirement 6: Multi-Modal Search Capabilities

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to search using both text queries and filters, so that I can find specific analytics data efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text query is provided THEN the system SHALL perform vector similarity search
2. WHEN filters are applied THEN the system SHALL combine vector search with metadata filtering
3. WHEN hybrid search is needed THEN the system SHALL merge vector and text search results
4. WHEN search scope is specified THEN the system SHALL limit search to relevant data types
5. WHEN time-based queries are made THEN the system SHALL apply temporal filtering
6. WHEN user-specific queries are made THEN the system SHALL filter by user permissions

### Requirement 7: Query Result Explanation and Confidence

**User Story:** As a business user, I want to understand why certain results were returned for my query, so that I can trust and act on the insights provided.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN search results are returned THEN the system SHALL provide confidence scores
2. WHEN results are ranked THEN the system SHALL explain ranking factors
3. WHEN vector similarity is used THEN the system SHALL show similarity scores
4. WHEN filters are applied THEN the system SHALL show which filters matched
5. WHEN no results are found THEN the system SHALL explain why and suggest alternatives
6. WHEN results are partial THEN the system SHALL indicate completeness level

### Requirement 8: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the query engine to handle high query volumes efficiently, so that the system can scale with user growth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing queries THEN response time SHALL be under 2 seconds for 95% of queries
2. WHEN handling concurrent queries THEN the system SHALL maintain performance
3. WHEN query load increases THEN the system SHALL scale processing capacity
4. WHEN memory usage is high THEN the system SHALL implement efficient memory management
5. WHEN database load is high THEN the system SHALL optimize query patterns
6. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL prioritize critical queries
