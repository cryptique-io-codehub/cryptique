# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on cleaning up and refactoring the existing codebase to improve maintainability, reduce redundancy, and create reusable utility functions. The goal is to identify and remove unused files, consolidate duplicate code into shared utilities, and simplify complex implementations while maintaining existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify and remove redundant and unused files, so that the codebase is cleaner and easier to navigate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the codebase THEN the system SHALL identify all files that are not referenced or imported by other files
2. WHEN analyzing the codebase THEN the system SHALL identify duplicate files with similar functionality
3. WHEN unused files are identified THEN the system SHALL safely remove them without breaking existing functionality
4. WHEN empty directories remain after file removal THEN the system SHALL remove those directories
5. WHEN markdown files are not actively used for documentation THEN the system SHALL remove them

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify and consolidate duplicate code blocks and functions, so that code maintenance is simplified and consistency is improved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing code files THEN the system SHALL identify functions or code blocks that appear multiple times across different files
2. WHEN duplicate API call patterns are found THEN the system SHALL create shared API utility functions
3. WHEN duplicate validation logic is found THEN the system SHALL create shared validation utility functions
4. WHEN duplicate database operations are found THEN the system SHALL create shared database utility functions
5. WHEN consolidating duplicate code THEN the system SHALL maintain the same functionality and behavior

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create a centralized utility library for common functions, so that code reuse is maximized and maintenance is simplified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating utility functions THEN the system SHALL organize them into logical modules (api, validation, database, etc.)
2. WHEN creating utility functions THEN the system SHALL ensure they are properly typed and documented
3. WHEN creating utility functions THEN the system SHALL update all existing code to use the new utilities
4. WHEN utility functions are created THEN the system SHALL ensure they handle error cases appropriately
5. WHEN utility functions are created THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to simplify complex code implementations, so that the code is more readable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing code complexity THEN the system SHALL identify overly complex functions that can be simplified
2. WHEN simplifying code THEN the system SHALL break down large functions into smaller, focused functions
3. WHEN simplifying code THEN the system SHALL remove unnecessary nested conditions and loops where possible
4. WHEN simplifying code THEN the system SHALL maintain the same functionality and performance characteristics
5. WHEN code is simplified THEN the system SHALL ensure all existing tests continue to pass

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure the refactored codebase maintains all existing functionality, so that no features are broken during the cleanup process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring code THEN the system SHALL run existing tests to verify functionality is preserved
2. WHEN removing files THEN the system SHALL verify no active imports or references exist
3. WHEN consolidating code THEN the system SHALL ensure all edge cases and error handling are preserved
4. WHEN creating utility functions THEN the system SHALL test them with the same inputs as the original code
5. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the system SHALL verify the application starts and runs correctly
