## Next Steps

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```
   cd cryptique/server
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set Up MongoDB**:
   Ensure your MongoDB instance is running and properly configured.

3. **Configure Webhooks**:
   - Verify the Coinbase webhook endpoint is properly registered:
     `https://app.cryptique.io/api/webhooks/coinbase`

4. **Test the Integration**:
   - Test creating a subscription with a test account
   - Verify webhook handling
   - Check CRM integration

5. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy with updated environment variables
   - Monitor initial transactions to ensure everything works correctly

## Limitations and Considerations

1. **Recurring Payments**:
   - Coinbase Commerce doesn't natively support subscriptions. For recurring payments, you'll need to implement a scheduled task that creates a new charge before the subscription expires.

2. **Webhook Security**:
   - Ensure your webhook endpoint is properly secured. The current implementation verifies the signature, but additional security measures may be needed.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - The error handling is basic. Consider implementing more comprehensive error handling, logging, and notifications for critical failures.

4. **User Experience**:
   - The UI is functional but minimal. Consider enhancing it with progress indicators, better feedback, and clearer instructions.

5. **Testing**:
   - Thoroughly test the integration with real-world scenarios before opening it to users.
