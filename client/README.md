# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Environment Variables

This application requires the following environment variables to be set in a `.env` file in the root directory of the client project or in your deployment platform (e.g., Vercel):

```
# API Keys for blockchain explorers
REACT_APP_ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_api_key
REACT_APP_POLYGONSCAN_API_KEY=your_polygonscan_api_key
REACT_APP_ARBISCAN_API_KEY=your_arbiscan_api_key
REACT_APP_OPTIMISM_API_KEY=your_optimism_api_key
REACT_APP_BSC_SCAN_API_KEY=your_bscscan_api_key
REACT_APP_BASESCAN_API_KEY=your_basescan_api_key

# Google Gemini AI API Key
REACT_APP_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key

# CQ Intelligence PIN for access control
REACT_APP_CQ_INTELLIGENCE_PIN=your_pin_code
```

**Important**: Never commit your `.env` file to version control. Make sure to add it to `.gitignore`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
