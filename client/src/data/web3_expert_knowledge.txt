Building Thriving Communities Around Your Product
The concept of community-led growth is often intimidating because it seems less straightforward than product-led growth. It feels operationally heavier, requiring constant interaction and engagement with users. However, the truth is that both strategies can work in tandem, with the product itself acting as a catalyst for community formation.
Instead of viewing community building as a separate task, consider it an integrated part of your product development strategy. By building with your users, not just for them, you create a powerful feedback loop that fuels both product and community growth.
Build with users not for users.
Key principles of building a thriving community:
1. Be Your Own First User
Before reaching out to your target audience, become intimately familiar with your own product. Use it daily, experience its strengths and weaknesses, and understand its potential value. This first-hand experience allows you to:
Empathize with user pain points: You'll personally encounter the challenges users face, making you more attuned to their needs.
Identify product champions: By understanding why you love the product, you can identify others who would resonate with its value proposition.
Discover your audience: Knowing your ideal user allows you to effectively target your community-building efforts.
Tactics:
Daily product usage: Make it a habit to use your product every single day, keeping user needs at the forefront.
Targeted outreach: Identify online and offline spaces where your target users congregate and engage with them.
Continuous feedback: Solicit feedback relentlessly, iterate quickly based on that feedback, and then seek feedback again.
2. Foster Authentic Connections
Early community members crave personalized experiences. While this high-touch approach might not be scalable in the long run, it's crucial for building a strong foundation. As Paul Graham famously said, “The most common unscalable thing founders have to do at the start is to recruit users manually.”
Tactics:
Personalized onboarding: Reach out to early users with personalized messages, offering support and gathering feedback.
Transparency: Embrace "building in public" by sharing your journey, challenges, and successes. This fosters trust and authenticity.
Casual interaction: Create informal spaces for users to connect with your team and each other, such as AMAs or casual online gatherings.
Direct engagement: Actively participate in community discussions, answer questions, and respond to feedback.
3. Create Genuine Collective Ownership
Empower your users to become active contributors and stakeholders in your product's journey. This sense of ownership fosters a deeper connection and encourages them to invest their time and energy in the community.
Tactics:
Feedback loops: Establish clear channels for users to provide feedback and suggestions, and demonstrate that their input is valued by implementing changes based on their feedback.
Collaboration opportunities: Create opportunities for users to contribute directly, such as through:
Events: Organize online or in-person events where users can connect, share ideas, and learn from each other.
Live sessions: Host live Q&A sessions, product demos, or workshops.
Reward systems: Recognize and reward valuable contributions through NFTs, tokens, early access, or exclusive content.
Shared success: Emphasize that the success of the product is intertwined with the success of the community (Reward Tags, NFTs or Tokens)..
4. Scale Through Community-Led Experiences
As your community grows, leverage its collective power to fuel further expansion. Encourage user-generated content, identify and empower evangelists, and establish rituals that strengthen community bonds.
Tactics:
User-generated content: Encourage users to create content related to your product, such as tutorials, templates, or reviews. This provides valuable resources for other users and strengthens community engagement.
Evangelist engagement: Identify passionate community members and empower them to become advocates for your product.
Community rituals: Establish recurring events or activities that foster a sense of belonging and shared identity.
Community as an Extension of the Brand
While community managers and moderators can play a valuable role, a truly successful community becomes an integral part of the brand itself. It should be woven into the fabric of the company culture and values, fostering organic engagement and self-sustenance.
The ultimate measure of a community's success is its ability to thrive even with minimal intervention from the brand. When users are so invested that they continue to connect, share, and support each other independently, you've achieved a truly remarkable level of community engagement.
Tokens and Community Alignment
Tokens align network participants to work together towards a common goal - the growth of the network & the appreciation of the token. Driving a powerful sense of ownership and collective growth.
Conclusion
Building a thriving community is an ongoing process that requires dedication, authenticity, and a genuine desire to connect with your users. By embracing these principles and implementing the suggested tactics, you can cultivate a passionate community that fuels both product and network growth.

What is a brand
A brand is the collection of beliefs that people have about your company.
Collection of beliefs: Is it cool? Is it useful? Is it exciting? Is it trustworthy? Is it fun to use? Is it a good value? Does it work?
People: Customers, Partners, investors, potential hires & the market
Company: Your product, your team & what you bring to the world
Brand building is the practice of proactively shaping these beliefs or a brand is the way you tell a story
How does it help
The ability to tell that story directly impacts the founders & businesses ability to raise capital, hire, retain talent & acquire users
Investors: They themselves raise capital based on the story they tell, therefore their belief in your potential depends on how you tell your story.
Potential hires: They want to find a place to do good work and advance their career. Their choices to work for you depends on how you tell your story
Employees: Need to feel motivated & mission aligned. Their commitment to the work and your mission depends on how you tell your story
Users: Need to know why they should care about what you’re doing. Their interest in your product depends on how you tell your story.
Crafting your brand story
A quote by Ben Horowitz, “In my experience, the CEOs who tend to be the best are the ones who are great at both building and selling. They can understand the product and technology deeply and also understand how to go to market, how to build a sales force, how to market and brand the company.”
Three steps to building a great brand story
Most of the examples are based on the company “Base”
Learn
Things you need to learn:
What problems are you trying to solve? (Be specific. Think functionally, not emotionally) [Example: Create an environment where useful crypto dapps can emerge to bring 1B+ users into the global crypto economy.]
Cryptique helps projects identify and incentivize valuable contributors while fostering thriving communities through data-driven insights.
Who is your customer? (Is there a big enough TAM? How frequently do they encounter this problem? How painful is it to experience the problem? [Example: Developers interested in building onchain]
crypto projects with active and expansive communities (Early to growth stage)
How does your customer feel about the problem? (Dont skip this! Its important. Again, be specific. Bad is not an answer) [Example: Developers are confused by which environments to build for and what tools are the best to do so.]
Crypto projects are frustrated as they are unable to gather feedback from communities and reward valuable contributors.
What solutions already exist? (Competitors or existing behavior your customers uses to solve their problem) [Example: EVM, Solana (Rust), Cosmos-SDK, et al.]
Telegram, Discord & Town
Where do these solutions come up short? (Is it too expensive? Too complex? Too slow? Has a sketchy/bad reputation?) [Example: Application infra is often not crypto-native: users can access crypto, but the environment aren’t necessarily native dapps that are enabled by crypto.]
The existing platforms are centralized, too complex, lack comprehensive community analytics, and lack seamless wallet integration.
Define
Questions you need to answer:
How does your product solve your customers' problem? [Example: ]
Why is your solution better than what already exists? (Both functionally & emotionally) [Example: ]
Why are you, as a founder, the right person to solve this? (Knowledge/ Expertise? Experience? Grit? Don't be afraid to flex on the team slide in your pitch deck (respectfully))  [Example: ]
Framework to organise your thinking
For _______ (Define the audience)
Who _______ (Define their problem)
<My company> _______ (define the solution)
That allow them to _______ (define the benefit)


Example: For developers who want to build on chain but are overwhelmed by the possibilities of how to build a best-in-class, crypto-native product Base is a builder-friendly Ethereum L2 that offers security, stability, and scalability to power on chain apps.

For crypto projects Who want to gather feedback and reward valuable contributors. Cryptique is a community platform that helps identify and reward valuable contributors, allowing projects to foster a purposeful community and drive effortless incentivization.
Craft
Questions your brand story should answer:
What's the big idea you want to lead with? The evocative idea that sets the stage for product marketing (Positioning) [Example: On their home page it says “Base is for everyone”]
Unlocking value for web3 communities
How does your product pay off that big idea practically? Functional explanation of the solutions you deliver. (Product messaging) [Example: their site starts with “Built for billions”, “Worldwide reach”, “Open and trusted” and “Transactions below one cent*” ]
“Effortless incentivization”, “Sentiment Analysis”, “Value Identification”
Why does the product matter right now? What bigger vision is your company aspiring to? (Vision/Mission) [Example: “We are bringing the world on chain to increase economic freedom” inspired from their mission, “Our mission is to increase economic freedom in the world” ]
Mission: Empowering communities, simplifying adoption
Mission2: 


What specific audiences do you need to tailor your story to, and what do they need to hear? (Customers vs. potential hires vs. investors, etc. Other examples: two sides of a marketplace; technical vs. nontechnical; creators vs. users, etc) (Audience messaging) [Example: ]
Crypto projects -> Helping crypto projects achieve PMF through community while optimizing resources.
Users -> Empowering users to create value, earn rewards, and seamlessly navigate a community where they truly belong. 
Investors -> Supporting the growth of increasing  number of web3 projects by helping them find their PMF
Potential Hires ->
Partners -> Helping drive web3 adoption by bringing in more users
How does your audience need to be spoken to? What's the best practice for your niche? Memecoin buyers are different from institutional investors are different from infra devs (Tone of voice) [Example: ]
A few last things
Brand amplifies value. But a good brand can’t save a shitty product.
Follow the process. Stupid first, then smart.
The more saturated/competitive your market, the more differentiated you need to be.
Narratives need fit. Adapt messaging as needed, and positioning if you need to pivot.
Don’t get distracted by the current meta.
Visual identity is extra important for B2C businesses.
Work with a partner, especially on craft. Start with independents or small teams.
Outside partners must pass the PAIL test (Public, Applied, Iterative, Long-term).
Don’t expect your brand to last forever; focus on getting to your next round of funding.

Types of GTM Models
Decentralization is a core principle that aims to distribute control and ownership across a network, rather than relying on central authorities.
Centralized & No token
Decentralized & Token (Decentralization has 3 dimensions):
Technical: Distributing computational resources and data across independent nodes to prevent single points of failure and censorship. This relies on open-source protocols and DLTs like blockchain for transparency and resilience.
Economic: Equitably distributing ownership and control through tokenization and decentralized governance (e.g., DAOs). This empowers users and prevents single entities from dominating the system.
Legal: Minimizing reliance on traditional legal systems by operating across jurisdictions and using tools like smart contracts. This fosters autonomy and resilience against regulatory capture.

Measuring Success in Web3: Key Growth KPIs
Web3 introduces a paradigm shift in how businesses measure growth and success. While traditional Web2 KPIs still hold relevance, Web3 companies need to consider additional factors related to community engagement, tokenomics, and on-chain activity. Here's a breakdown of key Web3 growth KPIs:
CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)
Web2 Focus: Traditional marketing & sales expenses (ads, content, staff).
Web3 Focus: Includes the above plus token incentives, community building (quests, etc.), and developer relations.
Key Takeaway: Investment in community and tokenized incentives is crucial for Web3 user acquisition.
LTV (Lifetime Value)
Web2 Focus: Customer's total spending on your product/service.
Web3 Focus: Expands to include user's contribution to the overall ecosystem (e.g., TVL in DeFi, activity in a DAO).
Key Takeaway: Web3 LTV is often about the value a user brings to the decentralized platform, not just direct revenue.
LTV:CAC
Web2 & Web3: A higher ratio signifies greater return on customer acquisition investment.  
Key Takeaway: Maximizing this ratio remains essential for sustainable growth, even with Web3's nuanced calculations.
Conversion
Web2 Focus: Percentage of visitors who make a purchase or complete a desired action.
Web3 Focus: Percentage of users who acquire an NFT, join a DAO, or engage in on-chain activities.
Key Takeaway: Conversion in Web3 often signifies active participation in the decentralized ecosystem.
Retention
Web2 Focus: Percentage of customers who continue using your product/service.
Web3 Focus: Measures ongoing engagement within the Web3 ecosystem (on-chain activity, community participation).
Key Takeaway: Web3 retention involves keeping users active and involved in the decentralized platform.
Churn
Web2 Focus: Percentage of customers who stop using your product/service.
Web3 Focus: Measured by wallet inactivity or declining on-chain engagement.
Key Takeaway: Web3 churn often indicates disengagement from the platform or a loss of interest in the project.
Engagement
Web3 Focus: Expands to include NFT acquisition, Discord/Telegram activity, DAO governance participation, and event attendance.
Key Takeaway: Measures the depth and breadth of user interaction within the Web3 ecosystem, both online and offline.
Share of Wallet
Web3 Focus: Proportion of user's crypto assets invested in your project (tokens, NFTs, DeFi protocols).
Key Takeaway: Indicates user loyalty and commitment to your Web3 project within the broader crypto landscape.
Web3 KPIs Emphasize:
Community Focus: Active engagement and participation are crucial.
Tokenomics: Token incentives drive user acquisition and retention.  
On-Chain Activity: Monitoring blockchain metrics provides valuable insights into user behavior and platform health.  
By understanding and tracking these Web3-specific KPIs, companies can make informed decisions, optimize their strategies, and achieve sustainable growth in this dynamic and decentralized landscape.



GTM Checklist
Below is a comprehensive framework for launching a product or service, especially in the Web3 space.
Collateral
This refers to the essential materials you need to communicate your value proposition and engage your target audience.
Boilerplate (written paragraph & verbal elevator pitch): A concise and compelling summary of your product/service, its key benefits, and target audience. This should be easily adaptable for different contexts (website, social media, presentations).
Mission Statement: Used to outline company’s goals and define industry position for customers, stakeholders & competitors. It's a concise statement that:
Guides the company's direction: It outlines the ultimate goal and the path the company intends to take to get there. 
This guides decision-making, resource allocation, and overall strategy.
A DeFi protocol might state its direction as "building a decentralized and accessible financial system for everyone." This guides their efforts towards creating products and services that align with this vision.
Highlights its differentiation: Shows how it stands out from competitors (Unique Value Proposition & competitive advantage).
An NFT marketplace might differentiate itself by focusing on "empowering creators with full ownership and control over their digital assets." This distinguishes them from platforms that take a larger cut or impose restrictions on creators.
Shapes its culture: Reflects its values, beliefs, principles and how it operates (Internally, with customers and wider community).
A DAO might emphasize "community-driven governance and inclusivity" in its mission statement, fostering a culture where all members have a voice and contribute to decision-making.
Allows for adaptation: Provides flexibility to evolve with the changing Web3 landscape.
A Web3 gaming company might state its mission as "creating immersive and engaging gaming experiences powered by blockchain technology." This allows them to explore new gaming genres and incorporate emerging technologies while staying true to their core
Benefit Statement: A concise, Customer focused statement that outlines the primary advantage of a company's product/Service. It should be:
Clear: Easy to understand.
Instead of saying "Our decentralized platform leverages zero-knowledge proofs to ensure privacy," a clearer benefit statement would be "Our platform guarantees your transactions remain completely private and secure."
Relevant: Connects with the audience's needs, desires, and Pain points.
For a Web3 game, a benefit statement that connects with players might be "Own your in-game assets and earn real rewards for your skills." This speaks to their desire for ownership and the potential for financial gain.
Efficient: Highlights how it makes things easier or better.
A decentralized storage platform might use a benefit statement like "Store your data securely and access it from anywhere, without relying on centralized servers." This emphasizes the increased efficiency and accessibility compared to traditional storage solutions.
Outcome-oriented: Focuses on the positive results users can expect.
A DeFi lending platform might use a benefit statement like "Earn passive income on your crypto assets with our secure and transparent lending protocol." This highlights the potential financial outcome for users.
Elevator Pitch: Why is an elevator pitch important
Establishes your brand: It's your concise introduction, conveying your identity and value proposition.
Operationalizes your time: Forces you to be succinct, saving time when networking and communicating.
Closes the feedback loop 
Internal: Refines your own understanding of your purpose and what you're building. By articulating it concisely, you identify gaps or inconsistencies in your own thinking.
External: Tests whether you've identified the right target audience and if your message resonates with them. Their reactions provide valuable feedback on your positioning and messaging.
1-pager: A one-page document that provides a more detailed overview of your offering, including key features, benefits, and use cases.
Sales/business development deck: A presentation deck used for sales pitches, investor meetings, and partnership discussions. It should tell a compelling story about your product/service and its potential.
Key messaging (by ICP type): Tailored messaging that resonates with your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP). This ensures your communication is relevant and addresses specific needs and pain points.
Website: Your online home base, providing information about your product/service, team, and vision. It should be user-friendly, informative, and visually appealing.
Developer documentation: If your product involves APIs or SDKs, clear and comprehensive documentation is crucial for developers to integrate and build upon your technology.
Case studies: Real-world examples of how your product/service has helped customers achieve their goals. This builds credibility and demonstrates value

Analysis
This section focuses on understanding your target market, competitive landscape, and potential partners.
Customer segmentation - ICP: Defining your ideal customer profile, including their demographics, needs, pain points, and motivations.
Distribution/channel strategy (B2B, B2D, B2C): Determining the most effective channels to reach your target audience. This could involve direct sales, online marketplaces, partnerships, or community building.
Competitive positioning: Analyzing your competitors to understand their strengths and weaknesses, and identifying your unique value proposition.
Partner categorization and prioritization: Identifying potential partners (technology partners, distributors, influencers) and prioritizing them based on their relevance and potential impact.
Process
