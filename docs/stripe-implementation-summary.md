     - `invoice.payment_succeeded/payment_failed`

### Frontend (Client)

     - CQ Intelligence add-on toggle
     - Payment method management
     - Subscription cancellation

3. **Integration**:
   - Updated `Billing.js` to incorporate the Stripe subscription component

## Next Steps for Implementation

1. **Create a Stripe Account**:
   - Sign up at [stripe.com](https://stripe.com) if you don't have an account
   - Obtain API keys from the Stripe Dashboard (Developers > API keys)

2. **Set Up Products and Prices in Stripe**:
   - Create the following products and monthly pricing:
     - Off-chain Plan ($59/month)
     - Basic Plan ($299/month)
     - Pro Plan ($599/month)
     - Enterprise Plan (custom pricing)
     - CQ Intelligence Add-on ($299/month)
   - Note down all the Price IDs (starting with "price_")

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the server directory
   - Add your Stripe secret key and price IDs
   - Example:
     ```
     STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_key
     STRIPE_PRICE_ID_OFFCHAIN=price_123
     STRIPE_PRICE_ID_BASIC=price_456
     STRIPE_PRICE_ID_PRO=price_789
     STRIPE_PRICE_ID_ENTERPRISE=price_custom
     STRIPE_PRICE_ID_CQ_INTELLIGENCE=price_addon
     ```

4. **Set Up Webhooks**:
   - For local testing:
     - Install the [Stripe CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli)
     - Run `stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:3001/api/webhooks/stripe`
     - Add the webhook secret to your `.env` file
   - For production:
     - Create a webhook endpoint in the Stripe Dashboard
     - Configure it to send the relevant events

5. **Test the Integration**:
   - Start your application
   - Navigate to the Billing section
   - Test creating subscriptions with test cards
   - Test the CQ Intelligence add-on
   - Test subscription cancellation
   - Verify webhook events are processed correctly

6. **Deploy**:
   - Update environment variables in your production environment
   - Set up production webhooks
   - Consider migrating test products to live mode

## Additional Considerations

1. **Security**:
   - Never expose your Stripe secret key in client-side code
   - Use HTTPS for all API calls
   - Validate webhook signatures to prevent spoofing

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement comprehensive error handling for payment failures
   - Add notification systems for failed payments

3. **User Experience**:
   - Consider adding email notifications for subscription events
   - Implement a grace period for payment failures before restricting access

4. **Analytics**:
   - Track conversion rates on subscription pages
   - Monitor subscription churn
   - Analyze popular plans and features
